When upgrading LibAdaLang a new version for Match Pattern has to be made.

1. Remove in Match Patterns (in rejuvenation library) 
all code between
         -- Begin of generated fragment using Rejuvenation_Lib_Generator --------
and
         -- End of generated fragment --------

2. In generator.ads (in this package)
update Filename_LAL_Ads and Filename_LALCO_Ads
to point to correct / new LibAdaLang version

3. Run program

4. copy output in Match Pattern (in rejuvenation library) 
between
         -- Begin of generated fragment using Rejuvenation_Lib_Generator --------
and
         -- End of generated fragment --------
         
use Code > Format Selection
or  Copde > Format file
 on added / all code 
(if desired / required to adhere to specific style)

5. rebuild rejuvenation library
